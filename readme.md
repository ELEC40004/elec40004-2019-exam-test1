Practise exam 1 : 10:00 Release
===============================

This is intended to reflect the style and format of the final ELEC40004
exam, in terms of knowledge coverage and rough difficulty. However,
it has not been as heavily vetted, so may contain errors or inconsistencies.
Knowing that we will not be dealing with errors, it's actually slightly
_less_ vetted before release (though with no intentional errors), so that
people will be on the look out for places where they need to make
reasonable decisions.

Selected Questions
==================

In your final commit you should check exactly two of these
check-boxes to indicate which questions your have decided
to answer:

[ ] - Question 1
[ ] - Question 2
[ ] - Question 3

If you do not tick enough boxes, or tick too many, then
Q1 and Q2 will be marked by default.

Note that you are welcome to try all three questions, but
you must select just two for assessment.

Errors in the Exam
==================

If you encounter an error or inconsistency in the exam, you
should attempt to work around it in the most appropriate,
sensible, and consistent way. You should not ask other
teams what their opinion is.

If you encounter any such bugs, document them in the file
`erratta.md`, and include it in your submission.

Practise aspects
----------------

Nobody is required to take part in this practise, and you don't
have to work on it for 8 hours. You can try working on it for
an hour then go do something else if you want. Nobody is watching
this or judging you, and it has zero impact on marks or our
perception of you. If you don't do anything at all today in
your repos, then no-one will mind or care.

Working and submission process
------------------------------

You should spend 8 hours on this exam, from your first commit
through to the last commit. However, you can start whenever you like
between 10:00 and 2:00 (+1) on the exam day.

### Initial clone and push

One of your team should clone this specification, and push it
to your shared repository at `elec40004-2019-exam-test1-${TEAM}`,
for whatever your value of ${TEAM} is. It should be of the form
`${LOGIN1}_${LOGIN2}`.

When this push is detected, you are considered to have started.

From that point on you should only look at the spec in your
private repository, and should ignore the globally visible spec.
Changes to the spec may be made for time-stamping purposes,
so you should always stick to the version you cloned.

### Working during the day

During the period you work on it, you should be pushing your
intermediate work at regular intervals - ideally at least every
60 minutes while you are actively working. It is strongly
reccommended that you push to remote feature branches rather
than merging and pushing to master.

Your commit history is your record of what you did and in
what order - it would be considered... odd, if there was
no activity for four hours, and then suddenly a whole
bunch of perfect code appeared at once. Your development
history should be your actual history, including partially
working code, or not-quite-compiling code.

### Submission

Your final submission is whatever the last commit is
on master, 8 hours after your first commit. Where there
are inconsistencies in timing, the timing of observed
pushes to github are used - we are well aware that github
timestamps can be faked.

Backup submissions via hash can be made through blackboard.
Note that this is only a temporary route to prove that you
completed work at a particular time. Eventually you'll need
to push the corresponding commit into github that matches
that hash, so you **must** keep hold of your local repositories
until you manage to push.

### Other details

Based on the results of this dry run we may change submission
routes slightly, or add more safety features. But for now
we just want to see how it works (and so can you).
