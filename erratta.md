If you encounter a problem with the exam questions, you should decide
on the most sensible/appropriate course of action, and document it
here.

For example:

### Q4/T2.1 - mispelling

There is a mis-spelling of the filename `test_cmpiler.sh` which is inconsistent
with other instructions.

We've assumed it should be `test_compiler.sh`
